# [AnimatePresence]: It manages the lifecycle of animations for elements entering and leaving the DOM, it wraps around the menu content, indicating that it should be animated when it appears or disappears.

menu content animation (motion.div)
# [inital]: This defines the starting state of the animation. Here, it's set to start with no opacity

# [animate]: This defines how the animation progresses. It specifies that the opacity should go to 1 (fully visible), creating a fade-in effect.

# [exit]: This defines how the animation behaves when the menu content is removed from the DOM. Here, it sets the opacity to 0, creating a fade-out effect.

# [transition]: This controls how the animation behaves over time

list items animation (motion.li)
# [initial]: This sets the starting state of the animation

# [animate]: This defines how the animation progresses. It specifies that the item should grow to its regular size (scale 1) and become fully visible (opacity 1).

# [transition]: This determines the animation behavior. It's set to a "spring" animation, which gives a bouncy effect

    # [stiffness] and [damping] control the bounciness, while [delay] creates a staggered effect, causing each item to start its animation slightly later than the previous one.
